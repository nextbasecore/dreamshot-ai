    <p>Dreamshot Image Editing Tool Service</p>

    <h2>1. General Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Services are offered "as-is," meaning refunds are not available for AI outputs that fail to meet your expectations, unless mandated by law.
    </p>

    <h2>2. EU Residents - Refund Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      If a technical issue prevents the service from functioning as outlined in our Terms and Conditions, you may request a refund within 14 days of use, in line with EU consumer protection laws. We'll assess and process eligible requests promptly as per our refund policy.

    <h2>3. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
    <h3>a. Cancellation Notice</h3>
    <p>
      To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, please cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the start of the upcoming period.
    </p>

    <h3>b. Processing Cancellations</h3>
    <p>
      Cancellations are processed immediately upon request, but your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period. You will retain access to all features until the current cycle ends.
    </p>

    <h3>c. Auto-Renewal Policy</h3>

      All subscriptions are set to renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle. You can disable auto-renewal in your account settings or by contacting us before your renewal date.
